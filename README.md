## Troubleshooting

### “Balance Timer” is damaged and can’t be opened.

If you're on a macOS and have downloaded the app, you're likely to see the message saying it's damaged. **It's not**. It's just apple trying to make me pay a hundred bucks for signing my free open-source app.

<details>
  <summary>More info</summary>
  Apple's policy is that every application must be signed with a Developer ID, which at the time of writing costs $99/year. Balance Timer is not sponsored and distributed open-source, so I don't expect to earn anything from it. Therefore it is not signed with such ID.

  When an unsigned app is downloaded from the internet, macOS marks it as "damaged" to prevent unidentified software from executing.
</details>

To **workaround** this warning follow these steps:
1. Launch the terminal
2. `cd` into the folder containing the executable
3. Run `xattr -cr "Balance Timer.app/"` (assuming you didn't rename the app)
4. Open the app normally from Finder, this time it should launch without warnings.

You'll only need to do this the first time you run the app.

> The release files are automatically built in a github workflow from the source code in this repository.

> Still, if you don't trust in the executable's integrity and don't want to run it, you have an option of building your own executable from source (described above).
